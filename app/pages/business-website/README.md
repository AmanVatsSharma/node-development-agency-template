### Layout & Responsiveness
- Unified vertical rhythm: `py-20 md:py-28` across sections
- Consistent content width via `container mx-auto px-4`
- Responsive animated globe: respects device pixel ratio and resizes on viewport changes

### Accessibility
- Sections are `role="region"` and labeled with `aria-labelledby`
- FAQ uses `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` for toggles
- Interactive controls include `aria-label`s where useful
- Reduced motion preference respected for the globe animation

### Logging & Diagnostics
Console logs are added across sections to aid debugging during development:
- Mount/unmount logs for each section
- Currency toggle and FAQ toggle logs
- Image load error logs in portfolio
- Globe initialization and draw errors

### Error Handling
- `SectionErrorBoundary` catches render-time errors and renders a safe fallback
- Portfolio images use a safe remote placeholder on load failure
