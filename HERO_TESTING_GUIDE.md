## üêõ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue: Tour doesn't auto-start
**Solution:** Check console for errors. Ensure 3 seconds have passed since load.

### Issue: Elements not clickable
**Solution:** Check if modal is already open. Close modal and try again.

### Issue: Low FPS on desktop
**Solution:** Check GPU acceleration in browser settings. Close other tabs.

### Issue: Tour button not responding
**Solution:** Ensure tour initialization completed (wait 3+ seconds after load).

### Issue: Modal doesn't close
**Solution:** Click √ó button or click outside modal. Check console for errors.

### Issue: Hover not working
**Solution:** Ensure cursor is directly over 3D element. Try different elements.

### Issue: Mobile too slow
**Solution:** Normal for low-end phones. Should be 30+ FPS on modern devices.

### Issue: Code typing not visible
**Solution:** Zoom in or wait for full animation cycle (6 seconds).
