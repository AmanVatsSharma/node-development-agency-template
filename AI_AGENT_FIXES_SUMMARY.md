# AI Agent Page Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå AI Agent Page Missing from Admin Sidebar
**Problem:** The `/admin/ai-agent` page existed but was not accessible via the admin sidebar navigation.

**Solution:** Added AI Agent to the navigation items in `/app/admin/layout.tsx`
- Added `Bot` icon import from lucide-react
- Added navigation item between "Newsletter" and "Integrations"
- Configuration:
  ```typescript
  {
    label: 'AI Agent',
    href: '/admin/ai-agent',
    icon: Bot,
    description: 'AI sales assistant config',
  }
  ```

### 2. ‚ùå Unable to Save Agent Configuration
**Problem:** Multiple issues preventing the save functionality from working:

#### Issue 2.1: Missing `systemPrompt` in API Response
**Location:** `/app/api/ai-agent/config/route.ts`
- GET endpoint was not returning `systemPrompt` field
- This caused the systemPrompt to be lost when loading and saving configuration
- **Fixed:** Added `systemPrompt` to both GET and POST response objects

#### Issue 2.2: Incorrect Authentication Method
**Location:** `/app/api/ai-agent/config/route.ts`
- API was using `getServerSession()` from NextAuth
- Project uses simple cookie-based authentication (not NextAuth)
- **Fixed:** Replaced with cookie-based authentication:
  ```typescript
  const sessionCookie = request.cookies.get(ADMIN_COOKIE_NAME)?.value;
  const adminPassword = process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD || 'changeme';
  const isAuthorized = sessionCookie === adminPassword;
  ```

#### Issue 2.3: Incorrect Prisma Import
**Location:** All AI Agent API files
- Files were using named import: `import { prisma } from '@/app/lib/prisma'`
- Prisma module uses default export: `export default prisma`
- **Fixed in:**
  - `/app/api/ai-agent/config/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/ai-agent/chat/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/ai-agent/convert-lead/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/ai-agent/conversations/route.ts`
  - `/app/lib/ai/contextEngine.ts`
- Changed to: `import prisma from '@/app/lib/prisma'`

### 3. ‚ùå Conversations API Authentication
**Problem:** `/app/api/ai-agent/conversations/route.ts` also had authentication issues
- Same NextAuth issue in GET handler
- GET_SINGLE helper function also had the issue

**Solution:**
- Fixed GET handler authentication to use cookie-based auth
- Fixed GET_SINGLE helper function signature and authentication
- Added documentation note about proper usage

## Testing Checklist

‚úÖ **Sidebar Navigation**
- [ ] AI Agent link appears in admin sidebar
- [ ] Link has Bot icon
- [ ] Clicking link navigates to `/admin/ai-agent`
- [ ] Active route highlighting works

‚úÖ **Configuration Loading**
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] All configuration fields are populated
- [ ] systemPrompt field is populated
- [ ] API key status shows correctly

‚úÖ **Configuration Saving**
- [ ] Can modify configuration fields
- [ ] "Unsaved Changes" alert appears when editing
- [ ] Save button becomes enabled
- [ ] Save button works when clicked
- [ ] Success message appears after save
- [ ] Configuration persists after page reload

‚úÖ **AI Agent Functionality**
- [ ] Test Agent button works
- [ ] Agent responds to test message
- [ ] Token usage is displayed
- [ ] Configuration changes affect agent behavior

‚úÖ **Authentication**
- [ ] Must be logged in to access page
- [ ] Must be logged in to save configuration
- [ ] Redirects to login if not authenticated

## Environment Requirements

Make sure these environment variables are set:
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Admin panel password (default: 'changeme')
- Database connection (for Prisma)
- AI provider API keys (OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini)

## Security Notes

1. The `/admin/ai-agent` page is protected by the admin middleware
2. The config API now properly checks authentication before allowing saves
3. API keys are never returned in responses (only hasApiKey boolean)
4. All admin pages have noindex/nofollow meta tags

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Consistency:** All AI Agent API routes now use the same authentication method
2. **Import Fixes:** Corrected prisma imports across entire AI agent module
3. **Documentation:** Added helpful comments about authentication and helper functions
4. **Security:** Ensured all admin endpoints properly validate authentication

## Known Limitations

1. The GET_SINGLE function in conversations API is a helper function, not a route handler
   - To use it, create a dynamic route at `/app/api/ai-agent/conversations/[id]/route.ts`
2. The authentication system is simple password-based (not role-based)
3. API keys are stored in database (consider using environment variables for production)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add role-based access control if multiple admin users needed
2. Add validation for configuration fields
3. Add audit logging for configuration changes
4. Add webhook notifications when configuration changes
5. Add configuration versioning/history
6. Add ability to rollback to previous configurations
