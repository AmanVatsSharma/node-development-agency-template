## 🔧 CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE

### **Adjust Animation Speed:**

// For counters:
const interval = 30; // Lower = faster, Higher = slower
```

### **Change Colors:**

from-indigo-500 to-purple-500 // Change to your brand colors

// Color mapping:
- Indigo: Primary brand
- Purple: Secondary brand  
- Pink/Red: Urgency/Action
- Green: Success/Growth
- Yellow/Orange: Speed/Energy
```

### **Modify Metrics:**
```typescript
// In hero-section.tsx:
setOldSpeed(Math.min(4.2, old)); // Change max value
setLeadsIncrease(Math.min(65, leads)); // Change target

// In growth-dashboard-section.tsx:
setInquiries(Math.min(150, inq)); // Change targets
setRevenue(Math.min(280, rev));
```

### **Add/Remove Cities (Growth Dashboard):**

  // Add more cities or adjust positions (x, y are percentages)
];

## 🐛 DEBUGGING TIPS

### **Console Logs Added:**
```javascript
// Check browser console for:
[Business-Website] HeroSection mounted - WITH Website Transformation
[Business-Website] Starting Website Transformation animation
[Business-Website] Old speed animation complete
[Business-Website] GrowthDashboardSection mounted
[Business-Website] Starting growth metrics animation
[Business-Website] DeviceShowcase mounted
```

### **Common Issues:**

**❌ Animations not playing:**
- Check if element is in viewport (scroll down slowly)
- Verify browser supports Intersection Observer
- Check console for React errors

**❌ Counters stuck at 0:**
- Animation triggers when `inView === true`
- Check if `useInView` hook is working
- Verify `amount: 0.2` threshold is appropriate

**❌ Layout shifts on load:**
- Add `min-height` to parent containers
- Reserve space with aspect ratios
- Use skeleton loaders if needed
