## 🚀 Quick Start

The mega menu is now live and includes all 13 landing pages organized professionally across:

## 📝 How to Add a New Service/Page

### Step 1: Add to Navigation Data
Edit `app/data/navigation.ts`:

```typescript

  items: [
    // ... existing items ...
    {
      name: "Your New Service",
      link: "/pages/your-new-service",
      description: "Brief description of the service",
      icon: "🎯",  // Choose an emoji icon
      badge: "New",  // Optional: Popular, Hot, Premium, Free, New
    },
  ],
