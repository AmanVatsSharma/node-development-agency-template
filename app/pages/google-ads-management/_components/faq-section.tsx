      question: 'How soon can I see results?',
      answer: 'Typically within 2–4 weeks of launch once data optimizations start. However, some clients see positive movement in the first week. Google Ads requires initial learning phase of 7-14 days, after which we implement aggressive optimization based on real performance data.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a landing page?',
      answer: 'Yes, we either improve yours or build a high-converting page for best ROI. A dedicated landing page typically converts 3-5× better than sending traffic to your homepage. We offer landing page optimization as an add-on service (₹10K-₹30K one-time).'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the ad spend included in your fee?',
      answer: 'No — you pay Google directly; our fee covers management & optimization. This keeps everything transparent. You maintain full control of your ad account and budget. We recommend a minimum ad spend of ₹30,000-₹50,000/month for meaningful results.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I get access to my Google Ads account?',
      answer: 'Always. You own the data; we just manage it professionally. We set up the account under your ownership and you can access it 24/7. We provide admin access and full transparency into all campaign settings, keywords, and performance data.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes you different from other agencies?',
      answer: 'We focus on ROI, not vanity metrics. Our team reviews data every 48 hours and optimizes continuously. We\'re certified Google Ads experts with 10+ years combined experience. Plus, you get transparent reporting, dedicated support, and you own all your data and accounts.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
      answer: 'Yes! We work on a month-to-month basis with no long-term contracts. We believe in earning your business every month through results. Just provide 15 days notice if you wish to discontinue.'
