      question: 'How long does the full audit take?',
      answer: '3â€“5 business days for the Professional package. The Enterprise package timeline is discussed during the kickoff call to ensure we cover all your specific needs. You\'ll receive a detailed timeline after booking.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you need access to Google Search Console?',
      answer: 'For deeper insights, we request read-only access to Google Search Console and Google Analytics â€” both are optional but highly recommended. This allows us to provide accurate keyword data, indexation issues, and performance metrics. We never make changes without your approval.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Will you fix the issues or only report them?',
      answer: 'We provide both options. Our standard packages include comprehensive reporting with detailed implementation guides and code snippets. If you need hands-on implementation, we offer hourly rates or monthly retainers. Many clients prefer our implementation service for technical fixes.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes your audit different from free online tools?',
      answer: 'Free tools only scan surface-level issues. Our audit includes manual review by SEO experts, competitive analysis, backlink quality assessment, content gap analysis, and a prioritized action plan tailored to your business goals. Plus, you get a 60-minute strategy call to discuss findings.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer a money-back guarantee?',
      answer: 'Yes! We offer a 7-day satisfaction guarantee. If you\'re not satisfied with the audit quality or deliverables, we\'ll either revise it to your satisfaction or provide a full refund â€” no questions asked. Your success is our priority.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you audit e-commerce or multilingual websites?',
      answer: 'Absolutely! We specialize in e-commerce audits (including product page optimization, faceted navigation, and schema markup) and multilingual sites (hreflang implementation, international targeting). Our Enterprise package is perfect for complex websites.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I only need help with specific SEO issues?',
      answer: 'We offer focused audits too. During the initial consultation, let us know your specific concerns (e.g., Core Web Vitals, backlinks only, or technical SEO). We can customize a package to address your exact needs and budget.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly will I see results after implementing fixes?',
      answer: 'Results vary based on competition and current site health. Technical fixes (like page speed and mobile issues) can show improvement in 2-4 weeks. Content and backlink work typically takes 60-90 days. Our clients average +38% organic traffic growth within 90 days of implementation.'
