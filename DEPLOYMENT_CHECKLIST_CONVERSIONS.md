## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue 1: Conversions not showing in console

**Diagnosis:**
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
// Look for gtag loading errors
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify gtag script is loaded (view page source)
2. Check that Google Conversion ID is configured
3. Ensure landing page is marked as Active
4. Clear browser cache and reload

---

### Issue 2: Conversions firing but not in Google Ads

**Diagnosis:**
```javascript
// Console shows: [Conversions] Fired {...}
// But Google Ads shows no conversions
```

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 24-48 hours for data sync
2. Verify conversion labels match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Check Google Ads conversion actions are active
4. Verify Conversion ID is correct
5. Test with Google Tag Assistant

---

### Issue 3: Admin dashboard not loading landing pages

**Diagnosis:**
```javascript
// API endpoint returns error
// or landing pages list is empty
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check database migration completed
2. Verify API endpoint accessible
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Review server logs

---

### Issue 4: "Landing page not found" error

**Diagnosis:**
```javascript
// Console: [Conversions] Landing page 'business-website' not found
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify slug matches exactly (`business-website` not `business_website`)
2. Check landing page exists in database
3. Ensure landing page is marked as Active
4. Re-run seed script if needed

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Step 1: Disable Tracking
1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Mark all landing pages as Inactive
3. This stops conversion tracking without code changes

### Step 2: Revert Code (if needed)
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
```

### Step 3: Restore Database (if needed)
```bash
# Restore from backup
# Or manually remove landing page configs
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DELETE FROM \"LandingPageConfig\";"
```
